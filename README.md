This project provides an interactive web-based tool to compare the performance 
of three different string search/autocomplete algorithms:

Single Hashing (Rabin-Karp style)

Double Hashing

Trie-based Search

Each algorithm is tested against a dataset of Indian states and their cities. 
The user can type input and select an algorithm to see autocomplete suggestions 
along with time statistics.
